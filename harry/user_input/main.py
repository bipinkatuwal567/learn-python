#In Python, we can take user input using input() function. This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable

#Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues when the user has given some input.

username = input("Enter your username: ")
print("Your username is ",username)

x = int(input("Enter first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(x + y)
