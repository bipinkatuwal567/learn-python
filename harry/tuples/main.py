# Tuples
# Tuples are ordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple items are separated by commas and enclosed within round brackets (). Tuples are unchangable meaning we can not alter them after creation. 

tuple1 = (1,)
print(type(tuple1))

details = ("Forest", 21, "ASMT")
print(details)
